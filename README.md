## Prerequisite
* Python 3 https://www.python.org/downloads/
* FFmpeg https://ffmpeg.org/

## Installation and usage
* To allocate ytdlp2STRM, I suggest using /opt/ in Linux or C:\ProgramData in Windows.

# Linux
* The next steps have been tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. In terminal:
```console
cd /opt && git clone https://github.com/fe80Grau/ytdlp2STRM.git
```
* Install requierments.txt
```console
cd /opt/ytdlp2STRM && pip install -r requierments.txt
```
* Copy service file to system services folder
```console
sudo cp config/ytdlp2strm.service /etc/systemd/system/ytdlp2strm.service
```
* Enable service
```console
sudo systemctl enable ytdlp2strm.service
```
* Start service
```console
sudo systemctl start ytdlp2strm.service
```
* Check it
```console
sudo systemctl status ytdlp2strm.service
```
* Check GUI in browser
```console
http://localhost:5000/
```


# Windows
* The next steps have been tested on Windows 11 Pro 22H2. Using Powershell or Windows Terminal with Administrator privileges:
```console
cd C:\ProgramData; git clone https://github.com/fe80Grau/ytdlp2STRM.git;
```
* Install requierments.txt
```console
cd C:\ProgramData\ytdlp2STRM; pip install -r requierments.txt
```
* Create a task that is scheduled to run main.py at startup. If you plan to install ytdlp2STRM in a different folder than C:\ProgramData\ytdlp2STRM, edit ./config/MS-TASK-ytdlp2STRM.xml
```console
schtasks.exe /create /tn "ytdlp2STRM" /xml C:\ProgramData\ytdlp2STRM\config\MS-TASK-ytdlp2STRM.xml
```
* Run task
```console
schtasks.exe /run /tn "ytdlp2STRM"
```
* In case everything is working, these commands will return "Running"
```console
(Get-ScheduledTask | Where TaskName -eq ytdlp2STRM ).State
```
* Check the GUI in the browser.
```console
http://localhost:5000/
```

# Docker
To deploy this as a Docker container, follow these steps in the ytdlp2STRM root folder.

* Build Docker image. The default host port is 5005, to change it edit Dockerfile and change the env value of DOCKER_PORT with the same port that you will configure in the docker run command.
```console
docker build . -t "ytdlp2strm" 
```
* Create a volume to preserve data.
```console
docker create --name ytdlp2strm-data ytdlp2strm 
```
* Run the container with volume and mount D:\media (host folder for accessing strm files, change it as you prefer) in /media (container folder).
```console
docker run -p 5005:5000 --restart=always -d -v D:\media:/media --volumes-from ytdlp2strm-data --name ytdlp2STRM ytdlp2strm
```
* Check the GUI in the browser
```console
http://localhost:5005/
```

# Docker HUB

* * Run container. To persist strm files, you must configure a volume, that is, a directory on the host that points to the /media directory in the container. Also, the default env value of DOCKER_PORT is 5005, make sure to put 5005 as host port or re-declare the env value of DOCKER_PORT like I do in the following screenshot.

# Additional info
* After that you can view all channels folders within /media/Youtube and their strm files. If you are using Jellyfin/Emby, add /media/Youtube, /media/Twitch ~~and /media/Crunchyroll~~ as folders in Library and enjoy it!

## New in v1.1.0
* **Season folders by year**: YouTube and Twitch videos are now organized in year-based Season folders
  - Structure: `Channel/Season {year}/S{year}E{XX} - video.strm`
  - Example: `Channel [ID]/Season 2025/S2025E01 - Video Title.strm`
* **UI improvements**:
  - New UI
* **Authentication improvements**:
  - All yt-dlp commands now properly use cookie authentication
  - Better handling of subscriber-only content on Twitch

## Youtube
* SponsorBlock doesn't work in redirect mode.
* Local NFO for each video
* audio- prefix
* **Season folders by year**: Videos are organized in `Season {year}` folders (e.g., Season 2025, Season 2026)
* **Episode numbering**: Files are named `S{year}E{XX}` format, resetting to E01 each year
* **Cookie authentication**: Supports both browser cookies and cookie files for age-restricted content
* **Language configuration**: Configurable audio language via `lang` parameter in config.json

## Twitch
* If a live video is on air the !000-live-channel.strm will be created. The script will download the strm for each video in the /videos channel tab in any manner. Take a look at the limits and daterange values for videos in ./plugins/twitch/config.json.
* SponsorBlock doesn't work in redirect mode, Twitch only works in direct mode at the moment.
* **Season folders by year**: Videos are organized in `Season {year}` folders (e.g., Season 2025, Season 2026)
* **Episode numbering**: Files are named `S{year}E{XX}` format, resetting to E01 each year
* **Cookie authentication**: Supports browser cookies for subscriber-only content

## TV3
* Plugin for 3cat, content in Catalan.

## ~~Crunchyroll~~
* ~~Requieres a cookie file from Premium user login (you can extract the cookie file from Crunchyroll with browser extension like https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc) or load a fresh cookie from browser (check discusion in https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/7442#issuecomment-1685036245).~~
* ~~Requires yt-dlp nightly build to work. `yt-dlp >=2024.05.22.232749.dev0`~~
* ~~Only works with login auth.~~
* ~~I'm using a filter language *your crunchyroll_audio_language config value* and extractor crunchyrollbeta:hardsub=*your crunchyroll_subtitle_language config value* to get a version with one language and subs embedded~~
* ~~To avoid constant rewriting of the strm files, a file called last_episode.txt is generated in the series directory, it contains the playlist position of the last strm downloaded, this will only generate strm for new episodes.~~
* ~~Patch yt-dlp if Crunchyroll not works https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues/7442#issuecomment-1637748442~~
* ~~`mutate_values.json` A particular file for this plugin. Overwrites the value of a specified field. For example, in cases where the season given by yt-dlp - season_number does not correspond to the actual season of the series. The available fields are as follows: season_number, season, episode_number, and episode.~~
* ~~direct mode. On Crunchyroll, the direct mode inherits the functionality of the download mode. ~~
* ~~bridge mode. Given the latest updates, it is necessary to obtain the audio and video streams separately, redirect their output, and remux both tracks to finally serve them over HTTP. Experimental, sometimes it may fail to start playback and you need to try playing it again. There is no timestamp and it is not possible to navigate through the video's timeline.~~
* ~~With download mode, the audio and video streams will be downloaded separately, and after downloading, they will be remuxed to finally serve a final video/mp4 file. The files will be downloaded to `./temp/` and their lifespan will be 24 hours. This is configurable in `config.json` -> `ytdlp2strm_temp_file_duration`. The Crunchyroll plugin in download mode will automatically download the latest discovered episode of each series declared in `channel_list.json`.~~
* ~~In the `config.json` file, and specifically for the Crunchyroll plugin, there are 4 parameters: `jellyfin_preload_last_episode`, `jellyfin_base_url`, `jellyfin_user_id`, and `jellyfin_api_key`. When configured with their correct values, they allow detecting if an episode is being played and pre-downloading the next one to achieve a seamless playback flow without interruptions.~~


## main.py 
A little script to serve yt-dlp video/audio as HTTP data throught Flask and dynamic URLs. We can use this dynamic URLs with youtube id video in url like http://127.0.0.1:5000/youtube/direct/FxCqhXVc9iY and open it with VLC or save it in .strm file (works in Jellyfin)

## cli.py  
* Controller that loads plugins functions, used in crons to manage strm files
* Build strms manually:
```console
cd /opt/ytdlp2STRM/ && python3 cli.py --media youtube --params direct
```
You can change --media value for another plugin

## config/config.json
* ytdlp2strm_host 
* ytdlp2strm_port
* ytdlp2strm_keep_old_strm
* ytdlp2strm_temp_file_duration

## config/crons.json
* Working with Schedule library (https://schedule.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples.html)
* Do attribute needs a list with commands ["--media", "youtube", "--params", "direct"], replace youtube with your plugin name and direct with your prefered mode.
* Custom timezone for each cron

* direct : A simple redirect to final stream URL. (faster, no disk usage, sponsorblock not works)
* bridge : Remuxing on fly. (fast, no disk usage)
* download : First download full video then it's served. (slow, temp disk usage)
* With download mode, the files in the temp folder older than 24h will be deleted.

* [YOUTUBE] Playlist needs "list-" prefix before playlist id, you can see an exaple in channel_list.example.json
* [YOUTUBE] If you want to get livestream from /streams youtube channel tab you need to add a new channel in channel_list with /streams (Check an example in ./plugins/youtube/channel_list.example.json)
* [TWITCH] This script makes a NFO file (tvshow.nfo) for each youtube or twitch channel (to get name, description and images). *Description only works in Linux systems at the moment
* ~~[CRUNCHYROLL] Only support URL series (not episodes), the script will create a folder for each serie, and subfolders for each season, inside season folder the strm episodes files  will be created~~

## Service
* LINUX: ytdlp2strm.service example service to run main.py with systemctl.
